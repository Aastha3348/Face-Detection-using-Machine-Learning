# Face-Detection-using-Machine-Learning
This project is based on Face Detection using Machine Learnng

## Machine Learning
  - As Machine Learning continues to emerge as a popular study there's a high rush among people in Technical field especially students to build their career in this field.
  - Machine learning is an application of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being
    explicitly programmed. 
  - Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it learn for themselves.
  - Machine learning is closely related to computational statistics, which focuses on making predictions using computers. 
  - The study of mathematical optimization delivers methods, theory and application domains to the field of machine learning.

## Face Detection:
  - Facial recognition is a technology that is capable of recognizing a person based on their face. 
  - It employs machine learning algorithms which find, capture, store and analyse facial features in order to match them with images of individuals in a pre-existing database.
  - The OpenCV method is a common method in face detection. 
  - It firstly extracts the feature images into a large sample set by extracting the face Haar features in the image and then uses the AdaBoost algorithm as the face detector.

 ## Python Library used :
 ### OpenCV
 - OpenCV is a library of programming functions mainly aimed at real-time computer vision.
 -  Originally developed by Intel, it was later supported by Willow Garage then Itseez. The library is cross-platform and free for use under the open-source Apache 2 License.
 
             $ pip install opencv-python

 ## Languages used :
 ### Python
  - Python is an interpreted, high-level and general-purpose programming language.
  - Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991.
  - Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace.
  - It is similar to English as the complications of writing the code is very less compared to other languages.
  - A 4 line printing code in Java can be done in 1 line in Python.
  - It can be used for other types of programming and software development besides web development
  - 
 ### Jupyter Notebook
  - The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text.
  - Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, data visualization, machine learning, and much more.
